Hi, my name is Savindu Senanayake and I am an undergraduate studying software engineering 📚. I am a passionate entrepreneur 💡, programmer 💻, and avid learner 🧠. In my free time, I enjoy coding 💻, traveling 🌍, and trying new drinks and foods (especially coffee ☕️ and tea 🍵). I am also a freelancer 💼, always looking for new opportunities to use my skills and grow as a developer 🚀. I am excited to be a part of the open source community on GitHub 🤝 and contribute to interesting projects 🔥.
